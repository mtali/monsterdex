## Demo

Monsterdex has two screens:

- List of Pok√©mon fetched from an API and stored in a Room database using paging.
- Detailed information about individual Pok√©mon.

## Tech Stack & Open-Source Libraries

- Minimum SDK level: 24
- Developed
  with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)
  and [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/)
  for asynchronous programming.
- Jetpack
  - [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle): Observe Android
    lifecycles and handle UI states upon lifecycle changes.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel): Manages
    UI-related data holder and is lifecycle aware, allowing data to survive configuration changes
    such
    as screen rotations.
  - [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room): provides an abstraction layer
    over SQLite.
  - [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose):  Android‚Äôs recommended modern toolkit
    for building native UI
  - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): Used for dependency injection.
  -
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (Compose - ViewModel - Model)
  - Repository Pattern
- [Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation): Provides
  navigation support for Jetpack Compose applications
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Used to construct REST APIs and handle
  paging network data.
- [Sandwich](https://github.com/skydoves/Sandwich): Provides a lightweight and modern response
  interface to handle network payloads on Android.
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/): A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [ksp](https://github.com/google/ksp): Kotlin Symbol Processing API.
- [Turbine](https://github.com/cashapp/turbine): A small testing library for kotlinx.coroutines
  Flow.
- [Material3](https://m3.material.io/): Material 3 is the latest version of Google‚Äôs open-source
  design system
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil): An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin
  Coroutines
- [Compose Animation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation/introduction):
  Powerful and extensible APIs that make it easy to implement various animations in your app's UI
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber): A logger with a small, extensible API.

## Architecture

**Monsterdex** is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern, which follows
the [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

# Modularization

The **Monsterdex** app has been fully modularized

## Types of modules in Now in Android

**Top tip**: A module graph (shown above) can be useful during modularization planning for
visualizing dependencies between modules.

The Monsterdex app contains the following types of modules:

* `app:` module - Contains app-level classes and navigation control. Depends on all feature and
  required core modules.
* `feature:` module - Specific to single responsibilities in the app. Reusable across different
  apps. Maintain isolation, keeping classes within the module if only used there.
* `core:` module - Houses common code and shared dependencies. Can be used by multiple modules. Do
  not depend on feature or app modules.
